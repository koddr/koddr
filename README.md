# Hello, everyone! üëã

My name is **Vic ShoÃÅstak** and I write interesting & very useful articles on my [Dev.to](https://dev.to/koddr) blog and do a lot of non-profit and Open Source projects on GitHub for people and robots. I'm one of the fathers of Go web framework called [Fiber](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber) and a lot of things around him. I'm the author of official logos for Go/Python web frameworks and tools such as [Asynq](https://github.com/koddr/asynq-logo), [Fiber](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber), [Create Go App](https://github.com/create-go-app/cli), [Starlette](https://github.com/koddr/starlette-logo) and [Quart](https://github.com/koddr/quart-logo).

Also, I'm developing a very helpful tool (with advanced ecosystem) to automate the process of initial preparation and deployment of full cycle projects written in Go by running one CLI command, called [Create Go App](https://github.com/create-go-app/cli).

So, I'm **Golang** lover, **UX** evangelist, **DX** philosopher and **UI** Dreamer with over **13+ years** of experience... whatever that means! üòÖ

## My work

All of this I do in my spare time from a main job, as a founder and Software Engineer at [True web artisans](https://truewebartisans.com/). The main areas of my specialization are Go, TypeScript, modern CSS, Docker and automation. On a personal basis, I do commercial consulting about UX of a product, selecting the best growth strategy and building a positive customer journey.
