# Hello, everyone! 👋

My name is **Vic Shóstak** and I write interesting & very useful articles on my [Dev.to](https://dev.to/koddr) blog and do a lot of non-profit and Open Source projects on GitHub for people and robots. I'm one of the fathers of Go web framework called [Fiber](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber) and a lot of things around him.

Also, I'm developing a very helpful tool (with advanced ecosystem) to automate the process of initial preparation and deployment of full cycle projects written in Go by running one CLI command, called [Create Go App](https://github.com/create-go-app/cli).

So, I'm **Golang** lover, **UX** evangelist, **DX** philosopher and **UI** Dreamer with over **12+ years** of experience... whatever that means! 😅

## My work

All of this I do in my spare time from a main job, as a founder and full stack web developer at [True web artisans](https://1wa.co/). The main areas of my specialization are Go, modern JavaScript & CSS, Docker and automation.
